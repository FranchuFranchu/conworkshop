# Contributing to ConWorkShop
Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to CWS! Every single person is important to the advancement of CWS.

This document describes the best method of contributing to CWS. Every contributor is expected to follow these guidelines
to a reasonable amount.

Please note that, even if you don't code, you can contribute with other things: you can also translate strings, write
documentation, help other contributors, create new assets or improve existing ones, and much more. Every single thing
helps.

## Before you start
* All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Ensure you have a working development environment, as described in the [README.md](README.md).
* If you're reporting a security vulnerability: **DO NOT USE THE ISSUE TRACKER**. Send a descriptive email to
  [conworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:conworkshop@gmail.com) and the ConWorkShop team will make sure to take care of it.

## Bug reports
The issue tracker should be used for bug reports. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Search for similar issues**. If you find a similar issue, use that issue instead of filing a new one, preventing
   issue duplication and unnecessary waste of time.
2. **Make sure it's a bug**. If you just need general CWS support, use the ConWorkShop boards.
3. **Add all relevant information**. If you could not find a similar issue, then file a new one and add all
   information that could be useful to determine the cause of the bug:
   * Ruby stack traces;
   * General version data: Ruby version, Rails version, OS platform and version;
   * **Tell, in detail, what you did to realize the bug.**
4. **File the issue**. You're expected to keep participating in the issue after it is filed, so make sure you either
   enable some form of notification for issues or that you check back frequently, in the case a developer asks
   follow-up questions.

Using these guidelines makes sure that bugs are fixed as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Also, if you want, you
can make a pull request to fix the bug, but read onto the next section.

## Features or bug fixes
The issue tracker should be used for features or bug fixes. Follow these guidelines:

* Please, do not make a pull request before filing a corresponding issue. This makes sure that the maintainers are
  aware that someone's planning on making a pull request, makes sure you don't waste time on something that is already
  being done, and lets you get feedback *before* you start implementing it.
  * If you're making a *very* small change, such as fixing a typo, it's okay to not make an issue first.
* Make sure the feature is within the scope of the project. ConWorkShop is a conlang/conworld management system and
  community.
* If working on code:
  1. Provide specs and documentation if possible. If fixing a bug, make a failing spec that shows the bug.
  2. Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and the
     [Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide).

After the issue or pull request is made, the CWS team will probably take a look at it and, if it's an issue, give the
go-ahead for a pull request, or if it's already a pull-request, review your work.

## Contacting the CWS team
* You can send us an email through [conworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:conworkshop@gmail.com).
* You can find us at CWS.
* You can find us at the CWS Discord (limited to registered CWS members).
